    <p>The idea of a youth Armed Force in India took shape after the 1948 Kashmir War, highlighting the need for a strong Armed Force to safeguard independence. The Cadet Corps Scheme, proposed by the Kunzuru Committee in 1946, was a prompt response to this requirement.
        The scheme was presented to the Constituent Assembly of India on 13th March 1948. The draft bill was introduced on 19th March 1948, and it was received with enthusiasm by the members of the legislature. The Bill was eventually passed through an amendment on 8th April 1948.
        In the subsequent stage, the Union Government obtained the consent of all Provincial Governments to initiate and implement the Cadet Corps Scheme. The Centre also accepted their suggestion to name it the "National Cadet Corps."
        The Bill received the Governor General's assent on 16th April 1948, leading to the establishment of the NCC under 'The National Cadet Corps Act 1948'. The organisation was formally launched in schools and colleges on 15th July 1948.</p>
